# enter-ghost
WIP Mystery tool that transforms JavaScript virtual file systems ðŸ‘»ðŸŽƒðŸ”®


Installing (it will be simplified soon):
```git clone https://github.com/hex13/enter-ghost
cd enter-ghost
npm install
node_modules/.bin/lerna bootstrap
cd packages/enter-ghost-ide
npm start
```

 âŒ˜O to open (it's WIP so only `*.js` files supported for now. Other files will open without proper syntax highlighting etc.)

After you open directory, application treat it as a folder root:
1. on the left side there will be Folder Tree view,
2. pressing âŒ˜P will display Find File view.
