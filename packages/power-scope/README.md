Power Scope is a static analysis tool (Work in progress).

It analyzes JavaScript files and gathers semantic information like:
- scopes
- variables
- structure of document (outline)

It's intended as library for use in e.g. editor extensions to implement such features like:
- go to definition
- autocomplete
etc.
