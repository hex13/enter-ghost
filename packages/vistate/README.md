### Vistate: smart actionable models instead of one big state container



#### *state of project: not ready for use in production YET. But keep watching*.



### Assumptions

1. ***Action dispatching*** is conceptually the same as ***method call***

```js
object.dispatch({type: 'increment', payload: 30});
```

is conceptually the same as:

```js
object.increment(30);
```

We just have some object (e.g. **model**, **store**, **entity** etc.) and we send messages to it (It is nothing new, it's just the old school OOP.).

But method calling requires less boilerplate so the approach `object.increment(30)` is preffered to the first one.

2. Sometimes we just need intelligent **models** which encapsulate both **state** and **logic**

3. Sometimes we need whole hierarchy of **models**

   ```
   [  -------------------------- Todo application -------------------------- ]
      	[ TodoList ]           	[ TodoList ]              	[ TodoList ]
       |      |      |        |      |      |             |      |      |
    [Todo] [Todo] [Todo]    [Todo] [Todo] [Todo]        [Todo] [Todo] [Todo]
                                      ^
     					we like to send an action to this Todo
   ```


   And it should be possible to send **action** to the specific **model** and work on **model level** (not **store** or **observable property** level). In Vistate the most important thing is a **model**.

4. Logic of dispatching the action and updating the state should be hidden from user.  There is some kind of magic behind scene. When user calls

 ```javascript
   counter.increment(30)
 ```

this could be dispatched in anyway possible. Action could be automatically recorded, previous state could be saved, subcribers could be notified. These things work automatically behind scenes, mainly in **middleware systems**. **Systems** are assigned to the **models** during creation.

5. Projects should be easily debuggable and inspectable (there will be **Dev Tools** for Vistate soon...)

6. Built-in solution for side-effects and asynchronicity (currently there are **transactions** for this purpose).

7. **Embracing inspiration**

   Vistate takes inspiration from *Redux, MVC, Smalltalk, SAM pattern, CQRS, event sourcing, DDD, Entity Component System, Vue, Vuex, Mobx, React, Django, Backbone, Rx, Redux Saga* and many other things.

   This means that although there could be some similarities with many other libraries and approaches but Vistate is not bound to one philosophy but it's inspired by many.

8. Immutability / mutability is an implementation detail.

   This framework started as being mutable. It promoted mutation of models directly in the action handlers:

   ```javascript
   ....
   increment(state) {
     state.value += 1;
   }
   ....
   ```

   Now there is ongoing transition to use immutable data, but the API stays the same. In current implementation action handlers just don't receive real **state** but only **proxy** objects. When an action handler calls

   ```javascript
   state.value += 1;
   ```

   This mutation is only recorded (not yet applied). This is the **model** that really applies these mutations. This is inspired by [SAM pattern](http://sam.js.org/) and its "proposed values". But the difference is that in Vistate there is a little bit syntax sugar to it.  To achieve this a little library called [transmutable](npmjs.com/package/transmutable) was created. You can try it yourself.

for examples of use check test cases because they are most recent source of truth: <https://github.com/hex13/enter-ghost/blob/master/packages/vistate/test/stateContainerSpec.js>

API is not stable yet so there can be breaking changes.

Latest breaking changes:

- 30/07/2017: Model class is gone. Create model from blueprints instead.
- 30/07/2017: model.$transaction and model.$register is gone
- 29/07/2017: $initialState is gone (use `data` param instead)
- 28/07/2017: $afterChildAction is gone
- no data() method in Transaction.
- transaction methods return promise

Examples of use:

```javascript

const { vistate } = require('vistate');

const model = vistate.model({
    data: {value: 100},
    actions: {
        inc(state, amount) {
            state.value += amount;
        }
    }
});

model.$subscribe(() => {
    console.log("update your view here");
    console.log("current state:", model.state);
    renderYourView();
});

model.inc();

```
